<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Reading Overview</h2>

<p>In this chapter, we focus on the tangible components of any
computer system: hardware. It is very unlikely that any of you will make a
career in microchip design. However, we are in the midst of a continuing
digital revolution. Digital computers impact every facet of our life. In fact,
you spend far more time with a computer than you do with your significant other
or your own family! Understanding the basics of how digital computers work is
as important today as being able to read and write. Nobody would argue against
the value of knowing English grammar, or basic math. By the same token, I hope
you understand the importance of knowing foundational IT concepts. A basic
understanding of computer hardware is part of having a cultural foundation to
navigate the world around you, like knowing that&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" target="_blank">Italy</a>&nbsp;is
in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a>&nbsp;and
that you put unleaded gasoline in your car because it has an&nbsp;<a

combustion engine</a>&nbsp;…. unless you have an&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car" target="_blank">electric car</a>.
Then you don’t have to worry about gasoline... but I digress....</p>

<p>Specifically, this chapter will help you to:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Understand the basic representation model that computers
     use.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Understand the link between Moore’s Law and CPU

     able to speak intelligently about the design of general-purpose computing
     machines.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Understand and be able to describe the stored program

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction</h3>


<p>In earlier chapters, we introduced Moore’s Law and we
discussed its importance in underlying those trends that over the last thirty
years have revolutionized the computer industry and our lives. As you recall,
the law states that the number of transistors etched on an integrated circuit
(i.e., a microchip) doubles every one to two years. We discussed the effects of
Moore’s Law: increase in processing power and memory, declining cost of
computing and, consequentially, the pervasiveness of easy to use computing
devices that are now embedded in so many aspects of our daily life. But how
does Moore’s Law work? What is the relationships between transistors and
computing power? And what is “computing power” anyway?</p>

<p>This chapter is devoted to answering these questions. We
start by covering a few basic concepts that explain how a digital computer
represents data and instructions, and how these data and instructions are
processed.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Digital Revolution</h3>

<p>If you have just recently passed your teens, you are a
so-called “digital native.” Author&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky" target="_blank">Mark Prensky</a>&nbsp;provided
the early definition of digital natives as those individuals who are “native
speakers of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet1.”
More generally a digital native is a person who grew up after the widespread
adoption of the Internet in the 1990s. The implication is that, having been
raised in a world dominated by digital technology, these individuals are
familiar with computers and the Internet from an early age. Of course, in any
subject matter there is a fundamental difference between familiarity and
mastery, and many digital natives are not at all proficient in their use of
digital technology. Yet, a digital native will generally turn to a digital
resource (i.e.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google
search</a>) before a physical resource (i.e., a library search) for her
information needs. As an aside, note that the expectation is that digital
natives are well versed in their use of digital computers, this is another good
reason to learn as much as you can from this class!</p>

<p>The term digital is pervasive in modern parlance. Here is a
small sample of definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary:2</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital economy</i>: “an economy which functions
     primarily by means of digital technology, esp. electronic transactions
     made using the Internet.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital money</i>: “money represented and held in a
     digital form which can be transferred electronically from one party to
     another.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital art</i>: “art created or modified using a
     computer or other digital medium.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital divide</i>: “the gulf between those who have
     ready access to current digital technology (esp. computers and the
     Internet) and those who do not.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital highway</i>: “a route or network for the
     high-speed transfer of information.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Digital footprint</i>: “a trace or the traces of a
     person's online activity which can be recovered by electronic means.”</li>
</ol>


<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Digital Signal Processing</h3>


<p>But what is this “digital” everyone is talking about? Can
you provide a clear and concise definition of the term? The word derives from
the Latin&nbsp;<i>digitus</i>&nbsp;which means finger. That’s why the muscle
that allows you to bend your fingers is called the&nbsp;<i>flexor</i>&nbsp;<i>digitorum
profundus</i>, and not the flexor fingerorum profundus.</p>

<p>Since the fifteenth century the terms has also referred to:
“<a href="https://public.oed.com/blog/word-stories-digital/" target="_blank">a
whole number less than ten</a>.&quot; As you know, the numerals we use for
computations [0 - 9] are called&nbsp;<i>digits</i>&nbsp;– perhaps because our
fingers were the first computation devices we ever had.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=158 id="Picture 7"
src="hardware.fld/image002.png"></p>

<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary provides a definition that
captures the modern use of the term digital as “relating to, or using
calculation by numerical methods or by discrete units.” The key term here
is&nbsp;<i>discrete units</i>. Discrete means individually separate and
distinct. It is the opposite of continuous. As if you were to count with your
fingers, using a digital system to represent information implies the use of
discrete values, as opposed to continuous units.</p>

<p>To understand this point, consider music. You are very
familiar with various forms of digital music. You may still own some music
on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc" target="_blank">Compact
Disc (CD)</a>&nbsp;and you certainly own an&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3" target="_blank">MP3</a>&nbsp;or
streaming music player. Most likely your music player is in the form of the
music app loaded on your smartphone, not its own separate physical device.
Digital music is music that is stored on your device as digital signals.
Following the definition of digital, a digital signal is a codified message
represented as a sequence of discrete values. I was a music loving youngster in
the days before digital music. I distinctly remember the advent of the&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3" target="_blank">MP3</a>&nbsp;format
and the first music sharing site,&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster" target="_blank">Napster</a>&nbsp;in
1999. Do you know how music was stored and played in those days?&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record" target="_blank">Vinyl
records</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape"
target="_blank">compact cassettes</a>&nbsp;where the devices we used, and music
was stored and reproduced by analogue signal. An analog signal is a codified
message represented as a continuous time varying variable that changes as a
function of the quantity it encodes. As the term implies, the codified signal
is an&nbsp;<i>analogue</i>&nbsp;of the source signal.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=351 id="Picture 6"
src="hardware.fld/image003.jpg"
alt="Graphical user interface&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>We don’t have to get too technical here. However, it is
important for you to realize that in an analog music recording, some physical
property of the recording medium will vary in a manner that is analogous to the
variation in air pressure produced by the sound waves of the original sound to
be recorded – as captured by a microphone. In a vinyl record, the physical
characteristics that is analogous to the sound is the grove cut in the surface
of the record. In vinyl records, the deviation of the groove from a smooth cut
is proportional to the recorded sound. In a compact tape cassette, the physical
characteristic that is analogous to the sound is the magnetization of particles
on the tape. The strength of the magnetization is proportional to the recorded
sound.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=300 id="Picture 5"
src="hardware.fld/image004.png"
alt="A picture containing text&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Conversely, a digital recording works by converting the
physical properties of the original sound into a sequence of numbers (i.e.,
digits). Those digits can be stored on any suitable medium. This is why you
could have digital music stored on a cassette tape or, in theory, even on a
vinyl record. The fundamental difference however is that the data are not
stored as a time varying analogue quantity to the recorded sound. Instead, they
are stored as a string of digits. No property of the digital music recording is
proportional to the original sound.</p>

<p>The first step in creating digital music is similar to the
one described above. A microphone will translate variation in air pressure
produced by the sound waves into electrical signals. However, instead of trying
to store these signals with some analogue physical quantity (e.g., groove deviation,
magnetization), the electrical signal is converted into a sequence of numbers
using an analog-to-digital converter.</p>

<p><a
href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/iot/lecture-3-1-analog-digital-conversion-Ga73m"
target="_blank">Analog to digital conversion</a>&nbsp;is a fascinating process.
For our purpose suffices to say that there are two steps:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Sampling</i>: The process of converting a continuous
     sound wave into a discrete signal by taking a number of measurements
     (samples) for each second of music. Sample rate is the unit of measure
     used for sampling. Typically, music is sampled at 44,100 samples per
     second (expressed as 44.1 kHz).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Quantization</i>: The process of approximating the
     actual sample value to a discrete set of values. This is necessary to be
     able to express all continuous values in the analog signal using a limited
     set of digital values. Bit rate is the unit of measure used for
     quantization.</li>
</ol>

<p>When music is digitized, the data that makes up a song can
be much more easily manipulated, for example with Auto-Tune or other effects
(click here for a&nbsp;<a
href="https://priceonomics.com/the-inventor-of-auto-tune/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=b20062b06a-Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-b20062b06a-70515489"
target="_blank">fascinating history of Auto-Tune</a>). You intuitively realize
that higher sample rates and higher bit rates will result in higher fidelity
reproductions of the music and larger files. In the earlier image about&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster" target="_blank">Napster</a>, if
you paid close attention, you could see two columns labeled&nbsp;<i>Freq</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bitrate</i>.
It should not surprise you to see the file size of the songs increase when
these two values go up. If at this stage it is not clear why, the discussion
below will explain.</p>

<p>In the early days of digital music, less than two decades
ago, many of us had to convert their existing music libraries into digital
music. The reason was that a tape, a vinyl record or a CD would contain tens of
songs. The very first iPod stored 1,000 songs!</p>

<p>If you have time watch this video, it is&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0SVBCJqLs" target="_blank">the launch of
the first iPod</a>.</p>

<p>The comparison between analog and digital is most
immediately understood in the context of music, but the move to digital is all
around you. Digital pictures sample and quantize light to create a numeric
(i.e., digital) representation of the shapes and colors in the picture. Digital
video works much the same way, but the images, called frames, are packed
together to fool your eyes into believing that smooth motion is occurring. If
you are getting this, you will immediately realize that the smoother the video,
the more frames it has, and the more frames in the video the larger the file
size.</p>

<p>It is legitimate to ask yourself, why so many analog devices
are being supplanted by digital ones? What makes “digital” better? There are
many advantages, but here is a list of the major ones:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Resilience</i>: Data stored in digital form is
     generally more resilient. Think about music again. A vinyl record is
     played by having a physical needle move within a physical groove in a
     plastic disk. Every time the record is played the groove is consumed ever
     so slightly, and some of the “data” are thus lost.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>No reproduction errors</i>: Digital data are perfectly
     reproduced every single time. Think of a song again. Once the data has
     been encoded numerically, it can be reproduced perfectly, with no error,
     every single time.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Versatility</i>: Analogue data require specialized
     equipment to be manipulated and reproduced. Conversely, digital data can
     be accessed and used by any digital device - provided of course that it
     has the right software to read the data. This is the reason why you need a
     specialized device, such as the&nbsp;<a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman" target="_blank">Walkman</a>,
     to listen to tape cassettes. Conversely, your&nbsp;<a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3_player" target="_blank">MP3 music
     player</a>&nbsp;can be an app that resides on any one of your computers –
     your smartphone, your laptop, your smartwatch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Digital data can be manipulated by digital computers – which
are of course a kind of digital electronics. We defined digital electronics as
equipment and components that manipulate digital signals. As we will see later,
manipulation of digital data is done through software, not through a physical
device. That’s why your laptop can be a radio, a music player, a TV, a
communication device to send and receive letters (i.e., email), a calculator
and a gaming device and almost anything else you can imagine.</p>

<p>&quot;Software is eating the world,&quot; and&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGI00HV7Cfw" target="_blank">this video
is the best visual representation of this statement</a>!</p>

<p>Ok, so, any digital signal can be processed, stored and
transmitted by any digital computer with the proper software. But why is that?
To understand this last piece of the puzzle we have to discuss the binary
systems and the advent of transistors… yes, back to Moore’s Law.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Binary System</h3>


<p>In a modern digital computer, the specific digital system
used to represent signals, data, and computations is the binary system. You are
certainly more familiar with the decimal system. Both the binary and decimal
systems are positional numeral systems. Positional numeral systems represent
values using an ordered set of digits. Each digit can take a limited set of
symbols. The number’s value is determined by the combination of the symbol and
its position. In the decimal system, we use ten symbols – [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9].&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku4KOFQ-bB4"
target="_blank">The binary system uses only two symbols – [0, 1]</a>. The
decimal system is also called “base 10” while the binary system is called “base
2.”</p>

<p>That the two systems are equivalent is easily demonstrated
by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4BstqvgBow" target="_blank">converting
from one to the other</a>. This is something you surely did in high school,
while you may have forgotten how to do it, it will immediately come back to you
if you try. A number in the binary system will have a value determined by the
position of its digits and whether that digit assumes a value of zero or one.</p>

<p>The binary system is the abstraction at the heart of digital
computers. It’s application to storing and communicating data was first
conceptualized by a 32-year-old researcher named Claude Shannon in 1948. In the
paper describing his theory Shannon proposed to use the term bit, short for
BInary digiT, as the smallest unit for measuring information. A bit can only
have two states, generally represented as 0 or 1. Intuitively you recognize
that combining bits together would allow us to represent more and more data.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=186 id="Picture 10"
src="hardware.fld/image005.png" alt="Text&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>This is all a bit abstract, but you can make it real very
quickly. Say I gave you a lantern to communicate with me at a distance into the
night. Could we create a “code” to make sure you could communicate with me? How
much information could you communicate? Well, we could agree that “lantern on
at midnight” means one thing (e.g., I’m happy) and “lantern off at midnight
means another thing” (e.g., I’m hungry). We synchronize our watches and we have
a way to communicate. Sounds silly? Well,&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Revere" target="_blank">Paul Revere</a>&nbsp;apparently
devised a system with two lanterns to signal when the British army would march
from&nbsp;<a href="https://oldnorth.com/the-events-of-april-18-1775/"
target="_blank">Boston on April 18, 1775</a>&nbsp;and which of two routes they
would take.</p>

<p>It would of course be impractical to have to agree a priory
on the meaning of each bit. In modern computing this problem is easily solved.
Each bit carries only one unit of information – the presence of absence of a
signal – a zero and one. Thus, one bit can store two pieces of data. With two
bits we can store four pieces of information. With eight bits, called a byte,
we can store 256 pieces of data.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=351 id="Picture 9"
src="hardware.fld/image006.png" alt="Table&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>As a testament to the importance of computing, the bit has
joined the meter, the gram, the liter, and the minute as a determinate quantity
— a fundamental unit of measure that enables modern life. I know, in the USA
you use the inch, the pound and other funny units of measure nobody else in the
world still employs… but my point stands. For data, we use the standard,
however there are&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/links/dataRate/DataMeasurementChart.html"
target="_blank">multiples conventions</a>&nbsp;accepted for other units of
measure (see table). Interestingly however, the bit is atomic, you can’t split
it. Unlike time, which is continuous, digital data are by definition discrete.
Thus, you can’t have a millibit or microbit – those terms are as nonsensical as
they sound.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=467 height=179 id="Picture 8"
src="hardware.fld/image007.png" alt="Table&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"><br>
Just like you can perform mathematical operations (i.e., addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division) using the very familiar base 10 numeric system, you
can do so with the binary system (base 2). For humans, base 2 is a bit more
cumbersome than base 10. But for a digital computer base 2 is quite natural.
Ironically, humans use a very cumbersome numbering system to measure something
as important as time – we use a base 60 system! This is another area where we
don’t need to get too technical. There are great resources for you to use if
you want to better&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgklPQ8rbkg"
target="_blank">understand how binary computations are performed</a>.</p>

<p>Creating the binary system as the abstraction necessary to
store data and perform computation was a breaktrhough in computing. But it is
only half the battle to create a working digital comptuer. In order for a
machine to do the work for us, we need a physical device that can represent a
binary numeric system. With such device, you could then get a machine to
perform these computations: enter the transistor!</p>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgDIX2GOaxQ" target="_blank">A
semiconductor is an interesting material</a>. It behaves like an electricity
conductor in some circumstances. Under other circumstances, it behaves like an
insulator. Most metals (e.g., copper, gold) are good conductors, and they let
electrical current flow freely through them. Most non-metallic solid material
(e.g., wood, plastic) are good insulators, showing extremely high resistance to
the flow of electrical charges within them.</p>

<p>Semiconducting material are quite unique in that they can go
both ways, showing properties of conductors and insulators depending on the
circumstances. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide an in-depth
explanation of the properties of semiconductors. You can find quite a bit of
information here from Intel6 – the largest chip maker in the world.</p>

<p>The most popular semiconductor material in the computing
industry is silicon, which is plentiful in nature. In fact, silicon is the main
element you find in regular sand and one of the most common elements of the
earth’s crust. But how do you go from sand to personal computers? How is sand
going to help us create autonomous cars that drive by themselves and reduce the
number of fatalities on the road? The transistor is the device at the heart of
Moore’s Law, and silicon is the key semiconductor material for making
transistors. A transistor is a semiconductor device that can switch electronic
signals and electrical power.</p>

<p>A modern transistor is built combining two opposite charged
semiconductor materials. The resulting device acts like an electronic switch.
When the base is charged, current will flow from the collector to the emitter.
The switch is in the ON position. When the base (or gate) is not charged
current will not flow from the collector to the emitter. The switch is in the
OFF position. One very important thing to note is that this “switch” has no
moving or mechanical parts of any kind. Electricity is all that is needed to
make it work. Thus, the speed at which it can be opened/closed is the speed of
electrical impulses.</p>

<p>When transistors were first invented they were assembled by
hand.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=419 id="Picture 11"
src="hardware.fld/image010.png"
alt="A picture containing text, electronics, tube&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>But thanks to the progress described by Moore’s Law, they
have been shrinking in size to subatomic levels. A modern transistor measures
in size on a nanometers scale (that’s 10-9 or 0.000000001 meters). Just to give
you a reference, the diameter of your hair is probably around 80 micrometers.
That means that you can fit about 4,000 transistors on it – give or take a few.
On a modern graphic card, the type used in your laptop or gaming device, you
will easily find 12-18 billion transistors.</p>

<p>Reducing the size of transistors has many advantages. They
can be closer together, thus reducing the time for electronic signals to travel
from one transistor to another. Smaller transistors also consume less power. At
this point you are probably beginning to see the relationship between Moore’s
Law (doubling transistors on a chip) and the miniaturization trend (smaller
computing devices increasingly available to the public).</p>

<p>More importantly, transistors can hold a charge with almost
no power consumption. As the transistor is charged, it can open or close a
switch. In other words, it can control an electronic gate for the flow of
electrical current. Thus, a transistor is a two-state device, open-closed
(charged-not charged). Are you starting to see the magic? Given their ability
to maintain their ON/OFF state, transistors are the physical devices we can use
to implement the binary system inside digital electronic devices. The fact that
they are microscopic enables us to link billions of them into integrated
circuits.</p>

<p>Transistors + Binary Circuit = Integrated Circuitry</p>

<p>At this point all the pieces are in place for you to
understand how simple, yet brilliant, the advent of the digital computer was.
Using electronic devices that could process electrical impulses (normally a
positive or negative charge), the binary system could be physically implemented
in machines that could perform computations and carry out instructions. As we
already know the binary system is the logical abstraction to bridge the gap
between humans and machines. The transistor is the physical device that
implements the abstraction.</p>

<p><b>Logic Gates</b></p>

<p>We have one last problem. A transistor can only take two
states, ON/OFF. So, a transistor is perfect for storing the value of one bit.
But how can you perform computations and carry out instructions? Without
getting too technical, the solution is to combine transistors into logic gates
and then use these logic gates as the building blocks of integrated circuits.
We will provide a simple example, so that you understand the concept, but if
you want to dig deeper into this&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kv5BF2Z9E" target="_blank">here is a
good start</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest context in which to demonstrate how logic gates
work is to implement some Boolean algebra with transistors. You surely have
experience with Boolean algebra, but you may have forgotten it. Here is a small
refresher. Boolean algebra is the branch of mathematics in which the values of
the variables can only be expressed as&nbsp;<i>TRUE</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>FALSE</i>,
usually denoted as 1 and 0 respectively. The basic operations of Boolean
algebra are AND, OR and NOT. The results of each one is expressed with truth
tables. Given two inputs, the result of an AND operation is TRUE (that is a 1)
only when both inputs are TRUE. The result of an OR operation will be TRUE when
at least one of the inputs is TRUE. The result of a NOT operation is the
opposite of the input. Given TRUE, the NOT operation returns FALSE – like that
annoying friend who is always playing devil’s advocate with you.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=174 id="Picture 15"
src="hardware.fld/image011.png"
alt="A picture containing table&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>A logic gate is an electronic device that implements Boolean
logic and binary math into physical components. The logic gates used in a
modern digital computer are built by combining transistors. Here is the
simplest example: creating an AND gate using two transistors. Remember how a
transistor works. If the transistor is placed between a source electricity and
an output it will act like a closed switch, no current will be allowed to flow
through. However, when the base of the transistor is charged, the switch opens
and current flows through to the output. Just putting two transistors in a
sequence where the output of the first one becomes the input of the second,
will implement an AND gate. If the base of neither transistor is charged, this
is equivalent to inputs being set to 0. The AND should output 0, and in fact
current will not flow through the first transistor. Charging the base of only
one of the transistor will open it, but the other will be still closed and
current will not flow through to the output. Only when the base of both
transistors is charged, equivalent to setting both inputs to 1 (or TRUE) in a
Boolean AND operation, current will flow through both the transistors. Thus,
the output of the circuit is a 1 only when both inputs are set to 1. We have
implemented a concept, the logical AND operator, in a physical circuit. We can
now use electrical impulses to carry out logical operations… like magic!</p>

<p>Well, guess what happens next? You probably already figured
it out, if you combine transistors into logic gates to perform simple
operations, the next stage is combining logic gates into more complex
electronic devices that perform more complex operations. That’s exactly what
happens, those “more complex devices” are called integrated circuits.</p>

<p><b>Integrated Circuits</b></p>

<p>It is important for you to visualize how, even just a small
combination of carefully placed basic logic gates, can perform
operations.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBDoT8o4q00"
target="_blank">Take time to watch this video</a>. It shows how your computer
adds two small numbers.</p>

<p>That’s it, this is the magic of computers. By using binary
logic as the abstraction and increasingly complex combinations of transistors,
a computer can use electrical impulses to perform computations. We have only
shown how to add two small numbers. But all you have to imagine is increasingly
complex combination of circuitry to perform other specialized basic operations.
Once you have the basic operations you can combine them to make complex
software programs. You can think of these basic operations like notes in music.
The notes are only seven, or 12 if you include all the tones. Yet, in the hands
of talented musicians (e.g.,&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin" target="_blank">Chopin</a>)
those few notes become beautiful music (e.g.,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZY5DBmgC_A" target="_blank">Piano Sonata
No. 2</a>). In modern computing, integrated circuits are combinations of
electronic circuits etched onto a silicon chip. They are generally called chips
or microchips. Modern integrated circuits typically combine millions of logic
gates (and billions of transistors). A microprocessor is an integrated circuit
that contains all the functions of the central processing unit of a computer.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Modern Computers: The von Neumann Architecture</h3>


<p>One of the effects of Moore’s Law has been the drastically
decreasing cost per unit of computing power and the miniaturization of
increasingly powerful integrated circuits – that’s of course what happens when
you can pack more transistors on the same area of a microchip. As a
consequence, we have seen the pervasive adoption of digital computers – more
than half of all humans on the planet at the time of this writing have access
to a smartphone and the Internet! More subtly we have seen computing capability
becoming embedded in an ever-increasing variety of objects.</p>

<p>With the dizzying pace of innovation in the IT industry, you
may be surprised to find out that the basic structure of a digital computer was
introduced over sixty years ago. More importantly, it has not changed since!
Many people contributed to the development of the science and technology
breakthroughs underpinning the evolution of digital computers – most notably
perhaps British mathematician&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>.
It was&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann"
target="_blank">John von Neumann</a>&nbsp;who articulated the basic structure
of such a computer in 1946. In a&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/wang_archi/supp/appendix_a.pdf"
target="_blank">report for the United States Army Ordinance Department</a>, von
Neumann describes in detail the design of a &quot;very high-speed automatic
digital computing system.&quot; He identifies five components that would be
necessary to enable the device to perform computations and to ultimately
process instructions to turn input into output. Those components, and their
relationship, are now called the von Neumann Architecture.</p>

<p>The first tangible implementation of this design was
the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC" target="_blank">ENIAC</a>&nbsp;at
the University of Pennsylvania. Being a war-time effort funded by the military,
the computations the machine was expected to perform were ballistic
calculations for projectiles. But the design was general enough that the
computer would complete any program it was instructed to run, as long as those
programs used a pre-specified set of instructions.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<i>logical design</i>&nbsp;of a digital computer
requires the following five major components:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Central Processing Unit: The Central Processing Unit,
     generally abbreviated CPU, is the electronic circuitry that performs the
     basic operations in a digital computer system. The CPU has two logical
     components. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which is the circuitry
     devoted to processing basic arithmetic and logical operations. And the
     Control Unit (CU), which is the circuitry devoted to processing
     input/output and control operations.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Primary storage: Primary storage, sometimes called main
     memory or internal memory, is the short-term data storage element of a
     digital computer that is directly accessible by the CPU. Primary storage
     is volatile, all its content is lost when the computer is powered off.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Secondary storage: Secondary storage, sometimes called
     external memory, differs from primary storage in that it is not directly
     accessible by the CPU. Secondary storage’s is the long-term memory element
     of a computer system. For this reason, unlike primary storage, it is
     non-volatile. That is, secondary storage holds data even when the computer
     is powered off.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Input devices: Input devices are the hardware interfaces
     between the external environment and the CPU. They enable control signals
     and data to be transferred from the environment to the computer system.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Output devices: Output devices are the hardware interfaces
     between the CPU and the external environment. They enable the result of
     CPU computations and data to be transferred from the computer system to
     the environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important for you to be able to identify and describe
the above five components of a modern computer. It is also important for you to
be able to articulate precisely what each one does. But it is most important
for you to understand what is their role in making the computer work. If you
are reading attentively you will have noticed that the five components
introduced above represent a&nbsp;<i>logical design</i>.</p>

<p>This is a term we will use many times in this course and it
is not to be confused with&nbsp;<i>physical design</i>. To understand the
difference just think about your own computer system. By now you do know the
importance of backing up your data. For your laptop, therefore, you may have
purchased two hard disks, an internal one that came standard, and an external
one that you use to store your backups. There should be no doubt in your mind
that each of those two hard disks is a secondary storage device. Thus, the
computer system has access to secondary storage, it just so happens that the
physical implementation of this component is in the form of two distinct
devices.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Physical Elements of Modern Computer Systems</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven decades after its original formulation, the von
Neumann architecture is still the logical design of the digital computer.
However, computer engineering has made great strides in this time span and the
physical design of modern digital computers has evolved significantly. Thus,
while the logical design of the first personal computer is the same as the
logical design of your newest smartphone, their physical design is so different
that most people don’t even realize the two are the same type of device at the
core. The most significant change in physical design has occurred along two
dimensions: a) form factors and b) number and variety of physical components.</p>

<p><b>Form Factor</b></p>

<p>In design, and particularly industrial and electronics
design, the term&nbsp;<i>form factor</i>&nbsp;refers to the definition of size,
shape and the other physical specifications of an object. The cellular phone
industry has a tradition of naming the major form factors making it a great
illustration of the concept.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=156 id="Picture 22"
src="hardware.fld/image015.png"
alt="A group of cell phones&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"></p>

<p>For another example of different form factors think about
how different four recent Apple devices look: Apple Watch, Apple Airpods,
iPhone and the MacBook Air. Yet, each of them is a von Neumann machine – a
digital computer.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=252 id="Picture 21"
src="hardware.fld/image016.png"
alt="A picture containing text, electronics, indoor, computer&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>The form factor of digital computers is so varied that most
people don’t even know how many everyday objects are in fact computers.
Arguably Tesla cars are digital computers, they certainly have all of the
components of the von Neumann architecture.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=458 height=180 id="Picture 20"
src="hardware.fld/image017.png"
alt="A silver sports car&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"></p>

<p><b>Physical components</b></p>

<p>Form factor refers to the external physical characteristics
of electronic devices. But the internal physical design of computers has also
evolved significantly in the last few decades. The main reason for this change
has been the increase in the number and variety of physical components that
computer engineers have been able to create. For each of the five elements of
the logical design we provide some examples. The list is not intended to be
comprehensive as we just touch upon the most important devices.</p>

<p><i>Central Processing Unit</i>: Early computers had one
microprocessor, the CPU, that contained all of the circuitry necessary to
perform mathematical (ALU) and control (CU) operations. The term microprocessor
is still used to refer to the CPU of a general purpose digital computer.
However, as the complexity of the tasks that computers are asked to perform
increased over time, the optimal solution was to parallelized CPU operations by
including multiple cores. Most modern microprocessors are multicore, even your
smartphone has a dual- or even quad-core CPU. A core is an independent
processing unit (e.g., a CPU) within a microprocessor.</p>

<p>Another major trend has been the development of specialized
microprocessors. Specialized microprocessors perform a limited number of highly
dedicated operations. At this point in your learning you should have no doubt
about how this is done: Transistors are organized in dedicated circuits that
perform the specific operations. These specialized microchips that have
specific instruction sets optimized for carrying out limited tasks (e.g.,
motion sensing and analysis) are called coprocessors or&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit"
target="_blank">Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)</a>. Apple
develops its own coprocessors for the iPhone – the&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_motion_coprocessors" target="_blank">M-series
coprocessors</a>. The M10, designed for the iPhone 7, collects, process, and
store motion sensor data even if the device is asleep.</p>

<p>The best example of a coprocessor is the GPU (Graphics
Processing Unit). A GPU is a specialized microchip with an instruction set
optimized for image processing. GPU excel at performing the same operation on
many data elements very quickly. This enables them to carry out functions such
as shading an area of the screen, moving a window or an icon from one part of
the screen to another, or decoding compressed video frames very quickly. GPUs
are critical for gaming devices, but increasingly are used in data centers
because they are well suited for machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>If you want to visualize the intuition behind the advantage
that ASIC and specialized microprocessors provide over general purpose CPU we
highly recommend that you play these slides explaining how the&nbsp;<a
href="https://storage.googleapis.com/nexttpu/index.html" target="_blank">Google
Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)</a>&nbsp;works.</p>

<p><i>Primary storage</i>: In a computer system primary storage
is smaller, faster and more expensive than secondary storage. A modern computer
has multiple physical elements that work together to deliver the
functionalities of primary storage:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Registers: Registers are very fast primary storage
     locations. They reside within the CPU and they are exclusively accessed by
     it. They contain the data needed by the operations being currently
     processed.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Random Access Memory (RAM): RAM is the most important
     primary storage component of your computer. In RAM a computer loads the
     applications and the data that are need to be available to the CPU. RAM is
     also used to store all the data that has yet to be saved to long-term
     memory. RAM is typically volatile, meaning that if it’s not powered, all
     content is lost.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Cache: Cache memory devices are very fast, but expensive,
     memory components. In a computer system cache is used to increase
     performance. You can think of it as a “staging area” for those
     instructions and data that are most likely to be need next by the CPU.
     Preloading such instruction from RAM into cache will enable the CPU to
     retrieve them more quickly, thus speeding up overall performance of the
     computer system.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Secondary storage</i>: In a computer system secondary
storage is larger, slower and cheaper than primary storage. The physical
implementation of secondary storage occurs through different storage media. A
storage medium (plural media) is an instrument of data storage, generally
defined by the material used to record binary representations of data.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Magnetic: Magnetic storage media, such as hard disks and
     storage tapes, are long term memory devices that record data by using a
     read/write head to magnetize the surface of the device.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Optical: Optical storage media, such as CD ROM and DVD,
     are long term memory devices that record data by burning the surface of
     reflective material and using laser to read it. The pattern of reflective
     and non-reflective areas of the CD surface represents bits of data.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Solid state: Solid state memory devices, like USB thumb
     drives and SD cards, differ from other storage media because they have no
     mechanical moving parts. For this reason, solid-state storage devices are
     light, they operate at the speed of electrical impulses and don’t need
     sealed enclosures. Thus, they are small, fast and rugged.</li>
</ul>

alt="A picture containing graphical user interface&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p><i>Input devices</i>: Input devices are continuously
evolving. Traditional input devices are the keyboard and mouse, but more and
more data for the CPU is today captured by microphones, cameras and all sorts
of sensors (e.g., positioning, motion, humidity, temperature, light). Your
smartphone, for example, takes input from an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a
compass, a barometer, a finger print scanner, an ambient light sensor, and of
course a capacitive multi-touch screen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-1gV196LUA"
target="_blank">This video shows new input devices in action: radar and digital
cameras</a>. Note how you often can hear a warning before you visually realize
that anything is happening on the road.</p>

<p><i>Output devices</i>: Output devices are the hardware
interfaces between the CPU and the external environment. They enable the result
of CPU computations and data to be transferred from the computer system to the
environment. Traditional output devices are the screen, the printer and the
speaker.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=320 id="Picture 18"

alt="Graphical user interface&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Today more and more data from CPUs is fed to actuators. An
actuator is a component of a machine that controls a physical mechanism by
receiving and acting upon a control signal. The Tesla Model X falcon wings
represent a great example. A computer processes the input from ultrasonic
sensors that measure the distance of objects near the car, and sends output
to&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.teslarati.com/teslas-falcon-wing-doors-work-explained-lego/"
target="_blank">actuators mounted on two hinges</a>. The result is a door that
can dynamically adjust its opening and closing angles based on obstacles within
its proximity....&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWWkVWUxis"
target="_blank">did I say that Tesla vehicles are digital computers disguised
as cars</a>?</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Modern Computers: The Stored Program Concept</h3>


<p>There was a second major breakthrough idea in that
1946&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/wang_archi/supp/appendix_a.pdf"
target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;by John von Neumann: the stored program
concept. As you recall, computer pioneers were focused on creating a general
purpose computer. But what is a general purpose computing machine? It is a
device capable of completing a variety of widely different tasks, without the
need for external intervention. Humans are of course the ultimate “general
purpose machine.” But in a digital computer the solution is the so called&nbsp;<i>stored
program concept</i>. The idea that the machine is able to process a small set
of elementary or primitive operations that can be combined to perform more
complex instructions. It is the job of a human programmer to write a complete
set of instructions that will enable the computer to complete the task. Today
that complete set of instructions is called a software program (the subject of
the next chapter).</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=207 id="Picture 23"
src="hardware.fld/image020.png"
alt="A person in a suit&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated with medium confidence"></p>

<p>You already know that in a digital computer the small set of
primitive operations - mathematical, logical and control - are physically
implemented using transistors in the form of appropriate combinations of logic
gates. The last piece of this puzzle is the concept of&nbsp;<i>instruction set</i>.
Chip designers combine logic gates and basic electronic circuitry into basic
instructions. Taken together, these instructions are called the instruction set
of the microprocessor. Without getting too technical, think of an instruction
set as the complete list of basic commands that the central processing unit can
execute. If a software program uses only commands from the instruction set it
should be able to complete a task without any “intelligent human intervention.”</p>

<p>Note that choosing a specific instruction set will generate
tradeoffs between cost, performance, power consumption, size and flexibility,
relative to the specific tasks the processor must complete (e.g., graphics
rendering). That is, operations from the instruction set can be executed
directly by the microprocessor. While more complex operations require
appropriate sequences of instructions from the instruction set to be completed.
There is an inherent trade-off between creating a general purpose integrated
circuit and a specialized one. The first one will have a larger instruction set
than the second. Thus, it will be able to perform more operations directly. But
given the same number of transistors on both chips, the second will have more
circuits dedicated to the same small set of instructions. Therefore, it will
perform more operations in the same timeframe, as compared to the more complex
one.</p>

<p>It should be clear now why designers create coprocessors.
Given a particular performance objective, if a task is specific and recurrent
enough to warrant a specialized microchip, one with a very specific instruction
set, designers will build it. A GPU is the best example. Graphics is a
computational intensive task if performed by a general-purpose CPU. So it makes
sense to create specialized processors, the GPU, with an instruction set dedicated
to graphics processing. Another example is Apple. The firm started including
the M-series coprocessors in the iPhone because it wanted to be able to track
phone motion even when the phone was asleep. For this task it needed a highly
specialized coprocessor that could gather and process motion data with minimal
power consumption.</p>

<p>The stored program concept captures the idea that a software
program, the complete list of instructions necessary to complete a task, are
stored in long-term memory. When the computer is asked to perform the task
(e.g., computer the trajectory of a missile, play your favorite radio station),
the appropriate program is loaded into RAM. Then, one at a time, each
instruction is loaded and processed by the CPU. When the task is completed, the
program is unloaded from memory and the space is now free for the execution of
a completely different task (e.g., write a memo in Word, watch YouTube videos).
The appropriate program is loaded and the work begins anew. It should be now
clear that the stored program approach enables the work of a general-purpose
machine… mission accomplished!</p>
