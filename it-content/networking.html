<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Introduction</h3>

<p>Up to this point we have developed a solid understanding of
foundational hardware and software concepts. The combination of hardware and
software yields a standalone digital computer. While standalone computers
dominated the early decades of the information age, the emergence of computer
networking unleashed much of the power that underpins modern digital computing.
To be a sophisticated end-user you must master the foundational concepts to
understand computer networking. The good news is that, as with hardware and
software discussed in previous chapters, technology is constantly changing but
there are a few unchanging concepts that underpin computer networking. Let’s
master them here and now.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computing Architecture</h3>

<p>According to the dictionary, the word architecture means:
&quot;the complex or carefully designed structure of something.&quot; With the
term computing architecture we refer to the arrangement of hardware and
software elements that enable computation. In the previous chapter, we
introduced the logical structure of software applications. We showed that the
logical design of any software application must include a presentation layer, a
logic layer and a data management layer. At that time, we assumed that these
three elements would reside in a monolithic application, for example Microsoft
Word, installed on your personal computer. In this chapter we show you that
this is not always necessary.</p>

<p><b>Mainframes and Terminals</b></p>

<p>As you know from the hardware chapter, early computers did
not fit in your pocket. In fact, they generally took up rooms, with the CPU
being housed in large cabinets referred to as “main frames.” The term stuck and
to this day a large digital computer supporting multiple users and multiple
peripherals is called a mainframe. Mainframes are expensive, they support
hundreds of simultaneous users and are used by organizations that require high
performance computing, such as research centers, governments, large
corporations and universities. But how do all these users access the mainframe?
They use terminals or, as they were called without much grace early on, “dumb
terminals.” In this context, a terminal is essentially an input/output device
with no processing power used exclusively to access a mainframe. The lack of a
local CPU is what characterized terminals as “dumb,” they are not Von Neumann
machines since they don't have the five components.</p>

<p>Today if you are using your powerful personal computer to
access a mainframe, you are not using local processing power and your computer
is simply acting like a terminal. In fact, if you have a Mac, the software
program you use to connect is aptly called “terminal” and its icon resembles an
old terminal screen (see if you can find it, launch it, and play with it). So,
where would the three elements of any software application you wanted to use
have to reside? On the mainframe, of course. The terminals have no
computational ability and cannot execute any instruction. Since all computation
is centralized in the mainframe, we call this a centralized architecture.</p>

<p><b>Standalone Personal Computing</b></p>

<p>What would you call the opposite of a centralized
architecture? A distributed architecture, of course! But what would it look
like? If in a centralized architecture you had one machine able to perform
computations, the mainframe, accessed by many input/output devices, the
terminals, in a distributed architecture those terminals would have to be able
to perform their own computations. This happened when Apple, and later IBM,
began to mass-produce and sell personal computers in the 1980s. Personal
computers are full-fledged Von Neumann machines with their own CPU. Thus, they
are able to execute instructions and run software applications independently.</p>

<p>As Moore’s Law continued relentlessly to improve the
computational power of microchips and the cost of computers plunged, Microsoft
introduced the dominant software application of the modern era: Microsoft
Office. Their vision of “a computer on every desk and in every home, running
Microsoft software” was becoming a reality. While these machines where not connected
to a computer network, it did not matter, as they could run their own software
programs. A computer network however offered many advantages, even in a
distributed computing environment. A network enables sharing - for example the
sharing of data. With standalone computers if a coworker needed to give you a
file she would have to put it on a portable storage medium, like a floppy disk,
and physically bring it to you. More importantly, the network enabled resource
sharing. Co-workers in an office would be able to share a printer, or storage
space. As these “islands of computing” became increasingly interconnected,
software architects realized that there was a lot of unused computational power
on the network. In fact, the boss may have the most powerful computer on his
desk, but that computer was often sitting there idle. Thinking of processing
power as just another resource that could be shared on the network introduced
the shared processing architecture.</p>

<p><b>The Client-Server Model</b></p>

<p>Shared processing, or the client server model as it is
generally called, is based on the idea of letting two or more machines share
the load of executing the instructions in a software application. In other
words, different computers execute the three elements of the same software application,
not one machine as in the previous architectures (i.e., the mainframe or the
personal computer). You intuitively understand that the client-server model
enables the optimization of computations across the network as a whole, rather
than for each machine independently. The first implementation of such an
approach entails separating the presentation layer from the logic and data
management layer. What would be the advantage of doing so? If you have been
carefully reading this book you can probably guess. If the local machine, a
personal computer, executed the instructions to render and manage the user
interface, it has enough power to run a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
However, by accessing a remote logic and data management layer over the network,
the application can use centralized, easily sharable data.</p>

<p>Let’s think of a very practical example. Think about one of
the dominant online travel agency in the US: Expedia, Inc. Think back about the
very first time you shopped for travel on Expedia. Probably you did so on a
personal computer, not through a mobile app. If you have never done it, go do
it now on their web page. Expedia, launched on October 22, 1996 – if you were
not yet borne please don’t tell me, I’d feel really old! But how did Expedia have
access to airline and hotel inventory? When it launched, and until recently,
the firm connected to one of the four&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system" target="_blank">Global
Distribution Systems (GDS)&nbsp;</a>called Worldspan.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=290 id="Picture 11"
src="networking.fld/image004.png"
alt="Graphical user interface, website&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Without the client-server model as an option, Expedia would
never have succeeded as a consumer business. No traveler in 1996 would have the
time or interest to learn special command line interface codes to access the
GDS and make their own travel reservation. But the ability to split the
application, and let the local computer run the presentation layer, enabled
Expedia to provide a simple user interface for travelers, while still allowing
them to use all the search features of the GDS (thanks to the centralized logic
layer) as well as accurate airline and hotel inventory data (thanks to the
centralized data management layer).</p>

<p>The client-server model introduced two terms that are very
familiar to you: client and server. In this context, a client is any software
program that can make structured requests to a server in order to access
resources that the server makes available. A server is a software program that
makes resources available to clients. These definitions may surprise you. The
reason is that you may imagine hardware, not software, when thinking of clients
and servers. That’s formally incorrect, and even though it is common
colloquially to not make the distinction, you need to be clear on the
difference. The proof is simple, on the same hardware (your personal computer
or your smartphone) you have multiple clients running at the same time. You are
probably running an email client (e.g.,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-business"
target="_blank">Microsoft Outlook</a>), a Web client (e.g.,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>), a
streaming media client (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/music/"
target="_blank">Apple Music</a>). On the same hardware in fact you may be
running some servers as well. When I was a PhD student, I used the desktop
machine sitting on my office desk to check my email (i.e., it ran an email
client). However, that same machine ran a web server, accessible all over the
world, that hosted my personal website as well as an application for people to
learn Microsoft Office through online tutorials – that was 15 years
before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>&nbsp;was
even launched! Clearly if the terms client and server referred to hardware, the
above scenarios would be impossible.</p>

<p>As you can imagine there are many different instantiations
of the client-server model. If you decide to make a career for yourself in
Information Systems you will learn them. For the purpose of this class you
should be familiar with two very popular client-server designs: the three-tier
architecture and the peer-to-peer architecture.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=215 id="Picture 10"
src="networking.fld/image005.png"
alt="Graphical user interface, application&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>In the three-tiers client-server architecture, each element
of the application runs on a different entity. There is a client, running the
presentation layer, an application server, running the logic layer and a
database server, running the data management layer.</p>

<p>In the peer-to-peer architecture, each peer makes a portion
of its resources, such as processing power, directly available to other
machines on the network without the need for central coordination. Each peer is
both a client and a server for other peers. The peer-to-peer model was
popularized by&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file-sharing_applications"
target="_blank">mp3 and file sharing applications</a>&nbsp;and it is today at
the heart of sharing networks such as&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" target="_blank">bit torrent</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Computing</b></p>

<p>Cloud computing, named after the icon traditionally used to
diagram the telecommunication network, uses the Internet to pool IT resources.
In other words, applications, computational or storage components—the building
blocks of IT solutions—“reside online” and are accessed by clients through the
Internet infrastructure. You can think of the cloud computing architecture as
an extension of the client-server model.</p>

<p>Consider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2"
target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, a service you surely have used in the past.
Dropbox provides users with cloud storage capacity to back up, store, and share
files, similar to&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage"
target="_blank">One Drive</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>. Until
recently, Dropbox was running and offering its service as a cloud solution
based on Amazon’s infrastructure—yes, the same Amazon that sells books!
Streaming services like Netflix or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/"
target="_blank">Spotify</a>, social services like&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, or companies
like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;are
all running on Amazon’s servers. This Web app you are using to read this line
also runs on Amazon!</p>

<p><img border=0 width=452 height=212 id="Picture 9"
src="networking.fld/image006.png"
alt="A picture containing weapon&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>But what’s all the hype? How is cloud computing different
from the data centers that were outsourced to large IT providers like EDS or
IBM? What is unique about the modern cloud computing approach is the notion that
the utilization of, and payment for, the resources used by the organization is
dynamic and agile. By agile, we mean that an organization that sees a growing
demand for its applications can scale the service relatively rapidly—major
infrastructure providers suggest that they can scale their service in a matter
of minutes. Moreover, the scalability is also flexible, allowing customers to
acquire different services, like storage or processing capacity. This is
significantly different from what happens in owned or outsourced data centers,
where dedicated hardware is purchased for, or assigned to, the client and
configured to run its applications.</p>

<p>The uniqueness of cloud computing is not only technical but
also characterizes how the service is managed. A typical cloud computing
provider adopts a utility billing model, whereby the user only pays for the
usage of the service in a metered fashion—just like you pay for electricity,
gas, and water as a function of your meter readings. Imagine a retailer’s
website after Christmas or the FIFA website a few days after the World Cup
Finals. As demand for the company’s application subsides and utilization drops,
so does the cost of maintaining the service.</p>

<p>Cloud computing parlance is differentiated along the three
main delivery modes: the application (SaaS), the platform (PaaS), and the
infrastructure (IaaS).</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Software as a service (SaaS): when an application runs in
     the cloud.&nbsp;<a
     href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/lightning/?d=70130000000f27V&amp;internal=true"
     target="_blank">Salesforce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.google.com/"
     target="_blank">Gmail</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"
     target="_blank">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;are classic examples of SaaS. Microsoft
     Office 365 is the SaaS version of the popular suite of personal
     productivity apps. The provider hosts the application in its data centers
     and the customer accesses the needed functionalities over a computer network.
     Thus, instead of licensing the application and requiring the customer to
     install it on his or her hardware, maintain it, and generally support it,
     in the SaaS model, the software vendor performs these tasks.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Platform as a service (PaaS): when what is being rented
     from the provider is not a full-fledged application but rather a platform
     on which the client builds its own applications. In that case, you would
     be renting the use of hardware (i.e., the servers in a data center on
     which all this software runs) along with the functionalities of operating
     systems and utilities (i.e., storage, security, backup and recovery,
     application serving, and the like). This model is generally used for
     development, testing, and deployment of applications, as components are
     already in place. For example, companies can use the platforms components
     from Force.com—the developers’ side of Salesforce.com—to create and deploy
     their own cloud applications.</li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): the level closest to
     hardware. In this case, the client purchases the use of hardware
     functionality—in essence, computational power, storage capacity, and
     network connectivity. In the IaaS model, you rent just the virtualized
     hardware. All software—including the operating system, backup and recovery,
     and the like—are your responsibility. The IaaS provider takes care of the
     running and maintaining the infrastructure, for a fee. Like all other
     cloud models, IaaS platforms offer scalable resources that can be adjusted
     on demand. The Amazon service that powers Netflix and Airbnb, called
     Amazon Web Services (AWS), is another example.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computer Networking</h3>

<p>Computer networking has emerged as an important area of
computing. It is so important in fact that you could take a whole sequence of
college courses on the topic. For this reason, in this section we focus only on
a few central concepts and vocabulary that will be useful to you in your career.
While we try as much as possible to limit the jargon, computer networking is
one of those topics where it is critical to be well versed in the language.
Without a mastery of common vocabulary, you will be quickly cut out from any
conversation on the topic.</p>

<p>The term network of course has a meaning that goes beyond
computing. A network is a collection of interconnected nodes. Just looking
around you can find many examples of networks. You, for example, have a family
network, a social network of friends, a professional network of fellow students
and co-workers. In all of these examples, people are the nodes of the network.
The interstate highway system is a collection of cities (the nodes) connected
by roads, and the fax network is a collection of analog fax machines (the
nodes) connected by telephone lines made of copper wires.</p>

<p>A digital computer network is a special kind of network. It
is a collection of digital computers connected through communication channels.
Communication on a computer network occurs when a sender directs a message
through a channel to a receiver using a shared language to encode the message
and a communication protocol to route the message and ensure its successful
delivery. That is a jam-packed sentence right there, but if we can successfully
unpack it and understand each element, it will give you a solid understanding
of computer networking. Let’s do it:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Sender: The network node that originates the message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Receiver: The network note that is the intended recipient
     of the message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Channel: The conduit, or set of different conduits, in
     which the message travels, from sender to receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Message: The information unit transmitted from the sender
     to the receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Language: The shared set of codes that enable the receiver
     to decode and interpret the sender’s message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Protocol: The agreed upon set of rules or conventions
     governing communication between network nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>A computer network is designed to enable communication
between digital computers. Thus, in this specific context the sender is a
software program, whether a client or a server, originating a message. The
message, which we defined as a unit of information, can take as many different
forms as there are software programs. Think about the various applications you
use every day that deliver messages and think about what the unit of
information would be for each of them. In some cases, this is straightforward.
For example, an email message is the unit of information for Microsoft Outlook.
A text message is the unit of information for Apple iMessage. An image with
descriptive tags is the unit of information for Instagram. In some other cases,
it is a bit more difficult to give a definite answer. What is the unit of
information for Pandora, the music streaming service? What is the unit of
information for a hotel reservation system, or for Netflix, or for a Tesla car?
What constitutes a message will vary from program to program, based on the
specifications agreed upon by the designers of those programs. For simplicity,
you can think of any discrete unit of information that is “meaningful” to a
software program, as a message.</p>

<p>Messages travel through a communication channel. These
channels are implemented using communication media. Just like we saw with
hardware, computer engineers utilize different physical media to implement
components of a system. For example, you are familiar with secondary storage
implemented on magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tapes and floppy disks), optical
media (e.g., CDs and DVDs) as well as solid-state media (e.g., flash memory).
The same applies to communication media, which can be broadly classified as
wired or wireless.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=429 id="Picture 16"
src="networking.fld/image008.png"
alt="A picture containing writing implement, stationary, pen&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Wired media entail a physical connection, or link, between
the sender and the receiver. In Local Area Networks (LAN) typical found in
offices, these links are copper Ethernet cables. Your house most likely is
wired using a coaxial cable, the same type of link used for cable TV. High throughput
links, like the Internet backbone, are instead typically wired using fiber
optic cables.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=408 height=648 id="Picture 15"
src="networking.fld/image009.png"
alt="Diagram&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Wireless media entail no physical connection, and the links
between sender and receiver are implemented through thin air… literally.
Examples include infrared light, used for example by your remote to control the
TV. And satellite communication as with the&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_Systemhttps:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"
target="_blank">Global Positioning System (GPS)</a>. But the wireless media
technologies you are most familiar with are surely the ubiquitous WiFi hot
spots and cell towers. While WiFi and cell towers use different communication
protocols, they both rely on the properties of electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic waves can travel over distance and, for some of them, through
objects! Electromagnetic waves travel at different frequencies in the
electromagnetic spectrum and, importantly, they can be manipulated to carry
analog and digital signals. Thus, they can be used as the channels of
communication in which digital computer messages travel.</p>

<p>While we differentiate between wireless and wired media,
there are plenty of hybrid arrangements. For example, when you download
Instagram photos on your smartphone while in your car (that’s cool only if you
are not driving!), you are using a wireless connection to reach a cell tower,
which in turn is connected to the Internet backbone via fiber optics.</p>

<p>One final note about communication media: how is it possible
for you to watch cable TV while surfing the internet at your house? After all,
there is only one coaxial cable leaving your home. Well, this is another
situation in computing when you have to think in terms of logical versus
physical designs. Without going into too many details consider that each
communication medium can use a range of frequencies within a given band to
transmit a signal. You can see this in the figure where the FM radio signal you
are quite familiar with transmits around the 100 MHz band. But as you know
there are many radio stations in that band. For example, your favorite public radio
station may transmit on the 89.3 MHz frequency while my favorite oldies station
is on the 98.5 MHz (ok, please no jokes about the fact that I know the
frequency of our local oldies station… 1990s rock and roll is considered oldies
these days).</p>

<p>The available frequencies for transmission within a given
band are the channels. You can think of each one as a logical (not physical)
link that can carry information. So, it does not really matter that there is
only one physical coaxial cable running to your house, as long as there are
enough channels to carry all the data you need. The term bandwidth refers to
the rate of data transfer of a communication channel. The measure of this rate
of transfer, also called bit rate or throughput, is bits per second (bps). The
same modifiers we used for storage capacity are used for bandwidth – thus we
speak of Kilobps, Megabps, Gigabps, and so on when measuring the throughput of
a digital communication channel.</p>

<p>The last of the concepts we introduced earlier is perhaps
the most important: protocol. Protocol is again a term that is not exclusive to
computing. When political dignitaries visit a different nation they generally
follow the international diplomatic protocol. We have a protocol that we follow
in class – at the most basic level we all wear clothes and arrive to class on
time. But just like people in social networks, computers in digital
communication networks need protocols. For computers, protocols are even more
important than they are for humans, since machines cannot deal with ambiguity
and uncertainty. The agreed upon set of rules that govern communication between
digital computers must be very stringent and precise.</p>

<p>It is also important for you to recognize that there isn’t
only one communication protocol but in fact a plethora of them. This is another
area of computer networking where we could spend a lot of time covering the
nuances of the many protocols and topologies of networks of the past. We could
discuss the many approaches used in LANs over the years, such as IBM’s token
ring, Apple’s AppleTalk, or many other approaches that took hold over time. But
that would not be a good use of our time. Instead, we will discuss protocols in
the context of the most important network of our time, the Internet.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">Computer Networking</h3>

<p>Computer networking has emerged as an important area of
computing. It is so important in fact that you could take a whole sequence of
college courses on the topic. For this reason, in this section we focus only on
a few central concepts and vocabulary that will be useful to you in your
career. While we try as much as possible to limit the jargon, computer
networking is one of those topics where it is critical to be well versed in the
language. Without a mastery of common vocabulary, you will be quickly cut out
from any conversation on the topic.</p>

<p>The term network of course has a meaning that goes beyond
computing. A network is a collection of interconnected nodes. Just looking
around you can find many examples of networks. You, for example, have a family
network, a social network of friends, a professional network of fellow students
and co-workers. In all of these examples, people are the nodes of the network.
The interstate highway system is a collection of cities (the nodes) connected
by roads, and the fax network is a collection of analog fax machines (the
nodes) connected by telephone lines made of copper wires.</p>

<p>A digital computer network is a special kind of network. It
is a collection of digital computers connected through communication channels.
Communication on a computer network occurs when a sender directs a message
through a channel to a receiver using a shared language to encode the message
and a communication protocol to route the message and ensure its successful
delivery. That is a jam-packed sentence right there, but if we can successfully
unpack it and understand each element, it will give you a solid understanding
of computer networking. Let’s do it:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Sender: The network node that originates the message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Receiver: The network note that is the intended recipient
     of the message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Channel: The conduit, or set of different conduits, in
     which the message travels, from sender to receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Message: The information unit transmitted from the sender
     to the receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Language: The shared set of codes that enable the receiver
     to decode and interpret the sender’s message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Protocol: The agreed upon set of rules or conventions
     governing communication between network nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>A computer network is designed to enable communication
between digital computers. Thus, in this specific context the sender is a
software program, whether a client or a server, originating a message. The
message, which we defined as a unit of information, can take as many different
forms as there are software programs. Think about the various applications you
use every day that deliver messages and think about what the unit of
information would be for each of them. In some cases, this is straightforward. For
example, an email message is the unit of information for Microsoft Outlook. A
text message is the unit of information for Apple iMessage. An image with
descriptive tags is the unit of information for Instagram. In some other cases,
it is a bit more difficult to give a definite answer. What is the unit of
information for Pandora, the music streaming service? What is the unit of
information for a hotel reservation system, or for Netflix, or for a Tesla car?
What constitutes a message will vary from program to program, based on the
specifications agreed upon by the designers of those programs. For simplicity,
you can think of any discrete unit of information that is “meaningful” to a
software program, as a message.</p>

<p>Messages travel through a communication channel. These
channels are implemented using communication media. Just like we saw with
hardware, computer engineers utilize different physical media to implement
components of a system. For example, you are familiar with secondary storage
implemented on magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tapes and floppy disks), optical
media (e.g., CDs and DVDs) as well as solid-state media (e.g., flash memory).
The same applies to communication media, which can be broadly classified as
wired or wireless.</p>

src="networking.fld/image008.png"
alt="A picture containing writing implement, stationary, pen&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Wired media entail a physical connection, or link, between
the sender and the receiver. In Local Area Networks (LAN) typical found in
offices, these links are copper Ethernet cables. Your house most likely is
wired using a coaxial cable, the same type of link used for cable TV. High
throughput links, like the Internet backbone, are instead typically wired using
fiber optic cables.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=408 height=648 id="Picture 17"
src="networking.fld/image009.png"
alt="Diagram&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>Wireless media entail no physical connection, and the links
between sender and receiver are implemented through thin air… literally.
Examples include infrared light, used for example by your remote to control the
TV. And satellite communication as with the&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_Systemhttps:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"
target="_blank">Global Positioning System (GPS)</a>. But the wireless media
technologies you are most familiar with are surely the ubiquitous WiFi hot
spots and cell towers. While WiFi and cell towers use different communication
protocols, they both rely on the properties of electromagnetic waves.
Electromagnetic waves can travel over distance and, for some of them, through
objects! Electromagnetic waves travel at different frequencies in the
electromagnetic spectrum and, importantly, they can be manipulated to carry analog
and digital signals. Thus, they can be used as the channels of communication in
which digital computer messages travel.</p>

<p>While we differentiate between wireless and wired media,
there are plenty of hybrid arrangements. For example, when you download Instagram
photos on your smartphone while in your car (that’s cool only if you are not
driving!), you are using a wireless connection to reach a cell tower, which in
turn is connected to the Internet backbone via fiber optics.</p>

<p>One final note about communication media: how is it possible
for you to watch cable TV while surfing the internet at your house? After all,
there is only one coaxial cable leaving your home. Well, this is another
situation in computing when you have to think in terms of logical versus physical
designs. Without going into too many details consider that each communication
medium can use a range of frequencies within a given band to transmit a signal.
You can see this in the figure where the FM radio signal you are quite familiar
with transmits around the 100 MHz band. But as you know there are many radio
stations in that band. For example, your favorite public radio station may
transmit on the 89.3 MHz frequency while my favorite oldies station is on the
98.5 MHz (ok, please no jokes about the fact that I know the frequency of our
local oldies station… 1990s rock and roll is considered oldies these days).</p>

<p>The available frequencies for transmission within a given
band are the channels. You can think of each one as a logical (not physical)
link that can carry information. So, it does not really matter that there is
only one physical coaxial cable running to your house, as long as there are
enough channels to carry all the data you need. The term bandwidth refers to
the rate of data transfer of a communication channel. The measure of this rate
of transfer, also called bit rate or throughput, is bits per second (bps). The
same modifiers we used for storage capacity are used for bandwidth – thus we
speak of Kilobps, Megabps, Gigabps, and so on when measuring the throughput of
a digital communication channel.</p>

<p>The last of the concepts we introduced earlier is perhaps
the most important: protocol. Protocol is again a term that is not exclusive to
computing. When political dignitaries visit a different nation they generally
follow the international diplomatic protocol. We have a protocol that we follow
in class – at the most basic level we all wear clothes and arrive to class on
time. But just like people in social networks, computers in digital communication
networks need protocols. For computers, protocols are even more important than
they are for humans, since machines cannot deal with ambiguity and uncertainty.
The agreed upon set of rules that govern communication between digital
computers must be very stringent and precise.</p>

<p>It is also important for you to recognize that there isn’t
only one communication protocol but in fact a plethora of them. This is another
area of computer networking where we could spend a lot of time covering the
nuances of the many protocols and topologies of networks of the past. We could
discuss the many approaches used in LANs over the years, such as IBM’s token
ring, Apple’s AppleTalk, or many other approaches that took hold over time. But
that would not be a good use of our time. Instead, we will discuss protocols in
the context of the most important network of our time, the Internet.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Internet Protocol Suite</h3>

<p>There is a stack (or suite) of protocols that enable digital
communication over the Internet. Discussing how they operate to enable your
daily web surfing, messaging, youTubing, Instagramming and the like is not only
valuable so that you know what you are doing. But it is also a good
illustrative example to understand how digital communication protocols work.</p>

<p>We have yet to formally define what the Internet is (spoiler
alert! It is a network of networks spanning the globe). But you have a clear
sense of what you can do on the Internet from your personal experience. How can
globally dispersed computing devices communicate reliably? The ultimate goal of
computer networking is to enable a given software application on one node to be
able to exchange messages with compatible software applications on a remote
node. An example is when you use Gmail on your smartphone to send me an email
as I am traveling through Spain. I receive and read that email on my Mac using
the application called Apple Mail. How does this process work?</p>

<p><b>Packet Switching</b></p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the telephone works? No, not your
smartphone! We already established in earlier chapters that that’s not a phone
but rather a digital computer. I am talking about a traditional phone. A
traditional phone relied on analog signals, continuous time varying signals
that represented the sender’s voice. Thus, the sound waves generated by your
voice, as captured by the microphone of your headset, would travel through the
wires and be rendered as analogous vibrations by the speaker of the recipient’s
phone. But how was the call routed? A dedicated circuit would have to be created
between your phone and the recipient’s phone, a method called circuit
switching. Early on, this was a manual process carried out by people, called
telephone operators, housed in special offices called private branch exchanges.
You may have seen this in old movies or black and white images from the 1950s.
These jobs disappeared when telephone companies invented automated switches,
but the end result did not change much. You still needed a dedicated channel
connecting sender and receiver. This is actually an acceptable approach for
point-to-point voice communication, since there is very little idle time on the
line during a verbal conversation. At the end of the conversation you would
simply replace the receiver and free up the channel for some other call.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=300 height=300 id="Picture 21"
src="networking.fld/image010.png"
alt="A picture containing text, electronics, telephone&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p>But what about digital communication? And more specifically
digital data transfer on a computer network? Would circuit switching be an
efficient approach? The answer is no, and the reason is that digital
communication is “bursty” rather than continuous. To convince yourself of this
fact, just imagine the data transfer occurring behind the scenes when you
navigate the Web. There is a burst of data transfer when the client (i.e., your
browser) requests the page and another when the server delivers it. Then there
will be some idle time while you read the content, followed by another set of
bursts when you click on a link. Tying up a channel for the time it takes you
to read the page is inefficient. In fact, it is even inefficient to occupy the
channel during the transmission of the web page. A better solution is packet
switching.</p>

<p>In a packet switching system the message is divided into
packets of standard size and standard configuration. Thus, to one message
(e.g., an email) will correspond many packets. The current packet routing
protocol on the Internet, IPv6, specifies a payload of about 65 kilobytes. If
you think that this chapter I am writing is already 4.5 megabytes in size, you
will see that if I were to send it to you as an email attachment, my email
message would result in upwards of 70 packets.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=572 id="Picture 20"
src="networking.fld/image011.png"
alt="A group of people in a room&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated with low confidence"></p>

<p>By design each packet is self-contained and independent.
That is, packets carry part of the original message (i.e., data) but they also
have a header with addressing information and sequencing information. More
specifically, each packet contains the sender and receiver addresses as well as
information about the packet’s position in the original message and many other
control fields. This header information is needed to route the packet, to make
sure it reaches the receiver, and to meaningfully reconstruct the original
message once all packets have arrived at destination. The fact that packets are
self-contained and independent is critical. It means that each packet can take
a different route from sender to receiver. Thus, instead of tying up a channel
for the duration of the communication, as in circuit switching, at each routing
station on the way from sender to receiver, each packet follows the optimal
route at that time. Moreover, if a packet is lost in transit there is no need
to resend the whole message. The receiver can request just the missing packet.</p>

<p><b>TCP/IP</b></p>

<p>The TCP/IP protocol suite governs data transmission on the
Internet. Early in the development of TCP/IP the designers introduced the
principles of encapsulation and layering to simplify complex end-to-end
transmission. Instead of trying to design a single monolithic protocol, they
opted for using multiple layers, or stack as it is called today, of independent
protocols. With encapsulation, each upper layer in a transmission could access
only what was needed from the lower layer. The most important layers of the
TCP/IP protocol stack are described below:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Application layer: It is the uppermost layer, the one used
     by the applications that end-users interact with. This is the domain of
     higher-level protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH (more on these soon).
     These protocols determine the application-to-application rules of
     communication. There are generally many applications running on one node.
     You have one smartphone but you probably have 40-50 apps on it.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Transport layer: It is the layer responsible for ensuring
     that a communication transaction occurs between the correct sender and the
     correct receiver. It is the protocol that specifies the node-to-node rules
     of communication. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) monitors
     problems in the transmission. For example, it requests retransmission of
     packets that may have been lost, it rearranges packets that arrive out of
     sequence and makes sure that the complete message as intended by the
     sender is passed up the stack. In the context of our email example, it is
     TCP that ensures that all the data comprising your message is properly
     received.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Internet layer: It is the layer that addresses the data
     packets and ensures that they reach their destination. The Internet
     Protocol (IP) is responsible for this layer in the Internet protocol
     suite. While logically TCP manages the message, IP manages the single
     packets. This is the layer that enabled the internetworking of different
     networks. As long each one can route packets, communication can traverse
     them despite their differences up the stack.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Routing</b></p>

<p>Another one of the original design principles of the
Internet was the end-to-end principle. According to this principle “intelligence”
should be located at the edges of the network with communication equipment
between nodes only responsible for routing packets. One of the reasons behind
this principle was the need for network resilience, such that if failure
occurred anywhere on the network communication could automatically route around
the problem, and scalability, such that any network or node could be easily
added to the Internet as long as it subscribed to the TCP/IP protocol.</p>

<p>A key element of this design was the router. A modern router
is a networking device that forwards packets it receives based on a map of the
network called a routing table. While modern routers are very sophisticated and
engage in substantial network traffic optimization, the minimal requirement for
a router is the ability to receive and forward packets.</p>

<p>To understand routing let’s discuss the addressing
mechanisms of the IPv4 Internet Protocol. While IPv6 has superseded IPv4 since
its launch in June 2012, the two are conceptually similar and IPv4 makes the explanation
simpler. IPv4 identifies a unique node on the network with an IP address of
four bytes, called octets in this context. For simplicity, each of the four
bytes would be represented in its decimal form which is much more memorable to
humans. Thus, an IP address is a sequence of four numbers, ranging each from 0
to 255, separated by a dot. For example: 172.217.12.46. By using 32 total bits
to represent a unique address, IPv4 provided about 4.29 billion unique
addresses. As a testament to the wild success of the Internet however, these
were going to run out a few years ago! That’s when IPv6 was introduced. It uses
128 bit for each unique address –that’s
340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible unique addresses.
We are not going to run out of them any time soon, even though the number and
range of devices that are getting connected is mindboggling. My recent
favorites are Internet connected lights from&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us" target="_blank">Phillips Hue</a>,
the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluesmart.com/" target="_blank">Bluesmart</a>autotracking
connected luggage, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://crockpot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Internet
connected crockpot</a>&nbsp;that you can turn on to warm up your chili as you
leave your office from home… I know, you can’t make this stuff up!!</p>

<p>Try typing http://172.217.12.46 in your browser. What
happens? Well, first of all you get a web page, which confirms that you can use
an IP address as a routing mechanism. Moreover, you should get the same outcome
from typing http://www.google.com/ - confirming that the two are indeed
equivalent. The latter is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a human readable
reference to a remote network node or resource. When you refer to a remote
resource on the network by its URL, this human readable address is resolved by
querying a Domain Name Server (DNS). The DNS translates the URL into the
corresponding IP address enabling communication to start as described above.</p>

<p>Let’s dissect a URL and extract its element. The exercise is
very informative. Take for example:
http://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/15a4810f25ed6315. This URL is pointing to an
email message in my inbox in Gmail. I am accessing it on Google Chrome, a web
browser, rather than a dedicated email client. Here are the elements of the
URL:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Protocol: http://. Unless it can be inferred by the
     application, the URL must specify the application protocol governing the
     communication. Note that different services and applications use different
     protocols. For example, when you visit a website, the interaction between
     your web client (i.e., your browser) and the server delivering the page,
     must follow the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When you send an email
     your email client must use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) set of
     rules if you want to be sure that the email is delivered and it is
     readable to the intended recipient.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Domain name: google.com. A domain name identifies an
     organization or other entity on the Internet. Domains must be unique and
     to obtain one you need to go through a registration process. Once you
     obtain a domain name you will be assigned one or more IP addresses and the
     DNS servers will update to reflect the correspondence between your domain
     and your IP address. As soon as that happens, you are reachable on the
     Internet!</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Top-level domain: .com. A top-level domain identifies the
     most general part of the domain name in an Internet address. When the Internet
     first became commercial there were just a handful of very distinct
     top-level domains: edu, gov, mil, net, org, com (we will let you guess
     what each one meant). All these applied to organizations in the US while
     every country had a top-level domain identifying them as a nation: it for
     Italy, au for Australia and jp for Japan just to name a few. That simple
     world is long gone and top-level domains, other than the national ones,
     have lost much of their meaning. Moreover, as another testament to the success
     of the Internet there are many more options: biz for business, adult for
     the adult entertainment domains (no kidding!), guru for generic expertise.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Subnetwork: mail. Within a domain a firm may have many
     different subnetworks and servers. We are using mail.google.com as an
     example, but within Google you could navigate to drive.google.com,
     photos.google.com and many other services the firm offers.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>File path: /mail/#inbox/15a4810f25ed6315. The URL must
     point to a specific resource. In the case of web pages that means a
     specific document. This is done in the standard fashion of computing
     resources simply identifying the file path including directories,
     subdirectories and the file name itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=175 id="Picture 19"

<p>If we return to the earlier example it should now be clear
how that email you sent with your smartphone will reach me all the way to
Spain. The application layer, following the SMTP protocol, encapsulates your
message, from start to finish ensuring that you use the correct email address
identifying the user (i.e., writer) and the domain (i.e., reimage-it.com). The
message is encapsulated by the TCP protocol and then the message is divided
into packets, each one with its IP address. Routers along the way forward each
packet until they reach the receiving node on the network. As the Internet
layer receives the packets they are passed up the stack to the transport layer.
There the TCP protocol ensures that the original message can be reconstructed
and there are no missing packets. At this point the data is passed up to the
application layer where, following the SMTP protocol, my email client
interprets the message as a new email from you and displays it accordingly. I
smile, as I am always happy to receive messages from my readers.&nbsp;<a

<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Internet</h3>

<p>A book chapter on computer networking must devote a special
section to the Internet, an invention that has truly revolutionized the world.
A brief look at any information systems textbook quickly reveals that the
Internet is, simply put, “a network of networks.” In other words, the Internet
is broadly defined as a collection of networked computers that can “talk to one
another.” This simple definition points to a fundamental issue: The Internet is
an infrastructure upon which services—such as e-mail, the web, instant
messaging (IM), and many others—are delivered.</p>

<p>Wikipedia, the free, web-based encyclopedia, provides a more
complete definition:</p>

<p>The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer
networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion
devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of
private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global
scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking
technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources
and services, such as mobile apps including social media apps, the inter-linked
hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic
mail, multiplayer online games, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file
sharing.</p>

<p>From this definition follow several observations, but before
discussing them, you should carefully note that the definition of the Internet
is very general and “device agnostic.” In other words, as a collection of
computer networks, the Internet can connect any device based on the digital
computer architecture—such as a laptop, a smartphone, a face-recognition digital
camera, and so on. Today there are more devices connected to the Internet than
there are people with access, and analysts predict that by the end of this
decade, Internet-connected devices will outnumber humans by four to one. The
extreme flexibility of the Internet protocol (as we saw earlier) is what allows
such scalability and variety of devices. Note as well that the general
definition above does not restrict the type of channel connecting these digital
devices across the Internet. In other words, if you are imagining an Internet
made of computers and cables, you should revise this mental picture, because
the channels are increasingly wireless—using radio signals, satellites, or
cellular technology.</p>

<p>The following video&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8CwafCxnU" target="_blank">features one
of the pioneers of the Internet and its protocols, it is well worth watching</a>.</p>

<p><b>Internet Services</b></p>

<p>As the Wikipedia definition suggests, the nodes of the
Internet “carry an extensive range of information resources and services.” A
common misconception is that the terms Internet and World Wide Web (or web) are
synonymous. This is incorrect, and it is important to differentiate the two.
The Internet is the infrastructure upon which many services are made available.
Typically, you will connect to the Internet, the infrastructure, to access the
services you want to use (e.g., email).</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (or the Web) is a service available on
the Internet and, alongside electronic mail, it is the most popular.</p>

<p><b>Distributed Ownership</b></p>

<p>The Internet is “publicly accessible,” meaning that no
single entity owns it, regulates its use, or otherwise controls it. In fact,
the Internet has many owners but no one who centrally controls it. In other
words, different portions of the Internet (i.e., different networks connected
to other networks) are owned by different entities—literally millions of them.
For example, your university network, while connected to the public Internet,
is privately owned by your university. Your university manages and pays for it.
Similarly, if you decide to launch your start-up upon graduation and need it to
have a web presence, you may decide to run your own infrastructure rather than
purchase it as a cloud-based service. In this case, you would maintain your own
web server and your own dedicated connection to the Internet, thus becoming one
of the many entities owning a small piece of the global network. Distributed
ownership has been perhaps the main strength of the Internet, limiting
regulation, fostering experimentation, and ensuring widespread access leading
to significant growth.</p>

<p><b>Multiplicity of Devices</b></p>

<p>The Internet is a digital network consisting of millions of
smaller digital networks. Each of these smaller digital networks encompasses a
collection of digital devices, called nodes. The simplest digital network to
visualize is perhaps a home network. Your home network may be composed of a
couple of personal computers and a printer to which both computers can send
documents. Using a home router, wired or wireless, and a broadband modem (e.g.,
cable, fiber, or DSL), you connect to the Internet. Each of these digital
devices—the two computers, the printer, and the router—are nodes on your home
network.</p>

<p>Your home network is a tiny contributor to the larger
Internet. The fancier ones among us may have more cutting-edge devices, such as
a connected thermostat for resucing the energy bill, a wireless media center to
stream music and videos from a computer through the living room stereo, a
wireless web cam to monitor the front door, a couple of tablets, and even
cooler stuff! A connected car—equipped with a GPS device, the OnStar system, or
a permanent Internet connection—is another example of a networked node, as is a
modern smartphone. As the price of microchips and bandwidth keeps dropping, the
number and type of devices that become nodes of a network will continue to
increase. In other words, the Internet is in continuous expansion.</p>

<p><b>Open Standards</b></p>

<p>The Internet relies on open technology standards and
protocols. As you know a protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules or conventions
governing communication among the elements of a network (i.e., network nodes).
On the Internet, such a set of rules is the TCP/IP protocol mentioned in the
Wikipedia definition. Nobody owns the TCP/IP protocol; as such, it is an open
(i.e., freely available) standard, as opposed to a proprietary one. The same
holds true for the other technologies that enable the Internet and its
services, such as HTML (the language used to write web pages). While there are
standard-setting bodies that decide how each of these technologies should
evolve (in the case of HTML, it is the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C), no
entity can charge for their use. Thus, anyone who wants to embed support for
these standards in his or her applications can do so . . . and innovation
continues to thrive on the Internet!</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Centralized architecture</b>: an architecture where all
     the computation happens in a large digital computer called mainframe,
     which is access through terminals.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel</b>: the conduit, or set of different conduits,
     in which the message travels, from sender to receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Client</b>: is any software program that can make
     structured requests to a server in order to access resources it makes
     available.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Cloud computing</b>: is a computer architecture that
     uses the Internet to pool IT resources.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Digital computer network</b>: is a collection of
     digital computers connected through communication channels. The elements
     of a computer network are: sender, receiver, channel, message, language, and
     protocol.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Domain Name Server (DNS)</b>: the DNS translates the
     URL into the corresponding IP address enabling communication to start as
     described above.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</b>: is hardware
     functionality—in essence, computational power, storage capacity, and
     network connectivity.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Language</b>: the shared set of codes that enable the
     receiver to decode and interpret the sender’s message.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Mainframe</b>: a large digital computer supporting
     multiple users and multiple peripherals.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Message</b>: the information unit transmitted from the
     sender to the receiver.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Modern router</b>: is a networking device that forwards
     packets it receives based on a map of the network called a routing table.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Multitenancy</b>: A software architecture where a
     single copy of software is instanced (runs) to serve all tenants. It is a
     defining characteristic of the cloud model and is behind services like
     Salesforce, Dropbox, or Gmail, just to cite a few.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Network</b>: is a collection of interconnected nodes.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Peer-to-peer architecture</b>: an architecture where

 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b>: A cloud soft- ware
     environment a vendor provides to customers on which the client builds its
     own applications. This model is generally used for development, testing,
     and deployment of applications, as components are already in place.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Protocol</b>: the agreed upon set of rules or
     conventions governing communication between network nodes.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Receiver</b>: the network note that is the intended
